# This file contains all parts known to BrickMesh. This is loaded into the
# PartModel class (along with the color model) that can then be used to get
# information about the parts.
#
# This is a protocol buffer file, the schema is described in
# part-model-proto.proto.
#
# An important part of the part model is the weight of parts. These are kept
# in separate CSV files so that we can layer data coming from different sources
# into a final model which is compiled by build_part_model.py
#
# Part entries in this file must be kept sorted with sort_part_model.py.

# ID space:
# g - generic id. Must be valid on BL, but can be tried in other contexts.
# ga - generic alternate id. Like g, but must not be valid in BrickLink.
# bl - id only valid on BrickLink
# l - id only valid in LDD
# v - virtual id, not valid anywhere
